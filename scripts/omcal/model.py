"""One event shape for every provider, and the join links inside them.

A normalised event:

    uid          "<account>/<calendar id>/<event id>": stable, and unique across accounts
    account      account name, as in accounts.json
    calendar     provider calendar id
    title        "(no title)" when there is none
    allDay       True for date-only events
    start, end   all-day: "YYYY-MM-DD", end exclusive (the day after the last)
                 timed:   ISO 8601 in UTC, "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    location     free text, or ""
    join         {"url", "kind"} with kind teams | zoom | meet | webex | telemost | other,
                 or None
    response     accepted | tentative | declined | needsAction | organizer | none
    organizer    True when the account owns the event
    status       confirmed | tentative | cancelled
    busy         False when the event is marked free/transparent
    recurring    True for an occurrence of a series
    seriesId     the series' id, for "edit all" later, or None
    editable     True when this account can change the event
    webLink      the event in the provider's own web app, or ""
    etag         the provider's version stamp, for safe edits later
    remind       minutes before the start to pop up a reminder, e.g. [10]; [] for none

Both providers are asked for end-exclusive all-day dates, and timed events are
kept as UTC instants: local time is applied only when something is displayed,
so a time-zone change never rewrites the cache.
