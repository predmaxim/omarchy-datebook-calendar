"""Every file this tool writes, reads back, or locks, and every provider reply.

Nothing here trusts a path to be what its name says:

- Directories are created 0700 and must be real directories owned by this
  account (never a symlink); a group- or world-readable one is tightened.
- Writes go to a fresh private file made exclusively (mkstemp: O_EXCL, 0600)
  in the destination directory, are flushed to disk, then renamed over the
  target. No predictable temporary name is ever opened, so nothing planted at
  one can be followed or truncated.
- Reads open with O_NOFOLLOW and O_NONBLOCK, accept only a regular file, and
  stop at a size cap, so a symlink, FIFO or huge file can't hang or exhaust
  the sync.
- The lockfile is opened without truncating (O_RDWR | O_CREAT, never O_TRUNC)
  and without following a link, and must be a regular file owned by us.
- Provider replies are read to a byte cap, within an overall deadline, before
  any JSON parsing.
