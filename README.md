# Datebook — Google Calendar and Microsoft 365 in Omarchy's clock

Click the clock and your actual week is there: every Google and Microsoft 365
calendar you have, in one place, with a Join button when a meeting's about to
start.

## What you get

Omarchy's clock opens a lovely month grid, but none of your appointments are
in it. So you keep a browser tab open for Google Calendar, another for
Outlook, and still miss the 2pm because neither one told you. This plugin
replaces the clock with a real calendar that knows about all of them.

**Everything in one view.** Sign in to a Google account and as many Microsoft
365 accounts as you have (work, a client's tenant, your own business), and
every calendar in them shows up together, each in its own colour. Tick the
ones you care about and hide the rest.

**Day, week, working week, month and year.** Switch with the buttons or
keys 1 to 5. The week shows meetings side by side when they overlap, and a
line for right now.

**It's two-way.** Answer invitations with Accept, Maybe or Decline, and the
organiser gets your reply. Create events (with guests if you like), move
them, rename them, set them busy or free, delete them. Recurring meetings
work too: answer or rename the whole series, or just this one. If someone
changed the event since you last synced, it tells you instead of
overwriting their change.

**Reminders you can join from.** A few minutes before a meeting, a
notification pops up. Click it and you're in the Teams, Zoom, Meet or Webex
call. Busy? Snooze it for five minutes from the calendar.

**Still Omarchy's clock when you want it.** One button folds it back to
Omarchy's own month, with just the day's appointments under it. One more
brings the full calendar back.

**Private.** It talks straight to Google and Microsoft from your machine.
There's no server in the middle, your sign-ins live in the system keyring,
and your events stay in your own cache. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

**Works with** Google Calendar (personal or Workspace) and Microsoft 365 work
or school accounts. Personal Outlook.com accounts aren't supported yet. You
register your own (free) Google and Microsoft app to sign in with: it takes
about ten minutes, once, and the steps are below.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/jonspinks/omarchy-calendar
# Put it where the clock is, then take the clock off the bar.
omarchy plugin enable blacksheep.calendar --before omarchy.clock
omarchy plugin disable omarchy.clock
```

If the clock was your bar's centre anchor (Omarchy's default), make the
calendar the anchor instead, so the centre of the bar stays centred:

```bash
t=$(mktemp ~/.config/omarchy/shell.json.XXXXXX) \
  && jq '.bar.centerAnchor = "blacksheep.calendar"' ~/.config/omarchy/shell.json > "$t" \
  && mv "$t" ~/.config/omarchy/shell.json
```

Then sign in to your accounts (next section). Until you do, it's the clock
you had, with an empty calendar.

## Sign in

Everything goes through `calendar-ctl`, in the plugin's `scripts/` folder:

```bash
C=~/.config/omarchy/plugins/blacksheep.calendar/scripts/calendar-ctl
$C add-google Personal ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json
$C add-microsoft Work --tenant <tenant-id> --client-id <app-id>
$C add-microsoft Client --tenant <tenant-id> --client-id <app-id>
$C sync
```

Google opens your browser to sign in. Microsoft shows a short code to enter
at microsoft.com/devicelogin. The names (`Personal`, `Work`, ...) are yours to
choose; they're how accounts are labelled in the calendar. Refresh tokens go
in the GNOME keyring (`secret-tool`), never on disk.

### Registering the apps

Google and Microsoft only let an app read your calendar if it's registered
with them, so you register your own. Nobody else's app ever sees your data.

**Google** (once): in the Google Cloud Console, make a project, enable the
**Google Calendar API**, and set up the OAuth consent screen with the scope
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`. Set its publishing status to
**In production** (Testing mode signs you out every 7 days; you don't need
Google's verification for your own use). Then Credentials → Create OAuth
client ID → **Desktop app**, and download the JSON.

**Microsoft** (once per organisation you sign in to): in the Entra admin
centre, Entra ID → App registrations → New registration (single tenant). Under
Authentication, turn on **Allow public client flows**. Under API permissions
add Microsoft Graph, delegated: `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `User.Read` and
`offline_access`. Note the application (client) ID and the directory (tenant)
ID. If the organisation requires admin consent, an admin has to grant it once.

### Yandex Calendar and other CalDAV servers

Yandex Calendar (personal or Yandex 360 for Business) is read and written over
CalDAV with an app password, so there is no app to register:

1. At id.yandex.ru → Security → App passwords, create one for **Calendar**.
2. `$C add-yandex Yandex you@example.ru` and paste it when asked (it isn't echoed).

Any other CalDAV server works the same way:
`$C add-caldav Home https://dav.example.org/ you` (add your email address
after the login if the login isn't one). Telemost links get a Join
button.

**Not yet:** Yandex doesn't expand recurring events for CalDAV clients, and
this plugin doesn't expand them itself yet, so a repeating event shows only
the occurrences that were moved or edited. Yandex also doesn't send its
reminders over CalDAV.

## Using it

- **Click an event** to open it: edit it, delete it, answer it, open it in
  Google Calendar or Outlook, or join it. **New** (or `n`) starts one on the
  selected day.
- **Calendars:** click one in the list on the left to show or hide it. A
  hidden calendar isn't downloaded at all. `calendar-ctl choose` does the
  same in a checklist.
- **Keys:** `1`–`5` views, `[` `]` or the arrow keys to step, `t` today,
  `n` new event, `w` to flip the first day of the week.
- **Language.** The interface follows the system language where a translation
  exists (English and Russian so far); set `"language": "ru"` (or `"en"`) on the
  bar entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` to choose. Translations live in
  `I18n.js`, keyed by the English text.
- **Sync** runs every three minutes while the shell runs, and when you open
  the calendar. `calendar-ctl sync` runs one by hand.

**Settings** (in the widget's entry in `shell.json`, all optional):
`"layout": "classic"` starts in compact mode; `"reminders": false` turns
reminders off; `"view"` is the view it opens in; `"format"` is the clock's
own format, and its 12- or 24-hour choice carries into the calendar.

**Key bindings:** the calendar answers IPC, so you can bind keys to it, e.g.

```bash
qs ipc -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell call blacksheep.calendar newEvent
qs ipc -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell call blacksheep.calendar view week   # day, week, workweek, month, year
qs ipc -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell call blacksheep.calendar toggle      # also compact, expand
```

## Remove

Sign out of each account first, while the tool is still there. That deletes
its tokens from the keyring:

```bash
C=~/.config/omarchy/plugins/blacksheep.calendar/scripts/calendar-ctl
$C list                 # the account names
$C remove Personal      # and so on, for each one
omarchy plugin remove blacksheep.calendar
omarchy plugin enable omarchy.clock --section center
```

What's left afterwards is the non-secret account list in
`~/.config/blacksheep.calendar/`, and the event copy in
`~/.cache/blacksheep.calendar/`. Both are safe to delete. To revoke access on
the providers' side as well, remove the app at
myaccount.google.com/permissions, and delete the app registration in Entra.

## Requirements

Omarchy (it's built on the shell's own clock and notifications), `python3`,
and `secret-tool` with a running keyring (Omarchy has both). `gum`, which
Omarchy ships, is used only by `calendar-ctl choose`. No sudo, no system
files, and no services: sync and reminders run inside the shell.

## How it works

`scripts/omcal/` does the talking. Google is fetched per calendar with
`singleEvents` and kept current with `updatedMin`; Microsoft uses Graph's
`calendarView/delta`. A copy of the next four months (and the last five weeks)
lives in `~/.cache/blacksheep.calendar/`, and the widget reads one file from
it. Every change you make is written straight to the provider, guarded by the
event's etag, then applied to the local copy at once, before the next sync
confirms it. Times are kept in UTC, and only turned into local time on screen.

`tests/run.sh` runs the tests: the widget's date, editing, reminder and
"next up" logic under node, and the sync's link-finding, time parsing and
de-duplication under Python.
